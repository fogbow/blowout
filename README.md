# SEBAL-scheduler

## What is SEBAL-scheduler?
SEBAL-scheduler is a tool for running the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) in a federated cloud environment managed by the [Fogbow Middleware](http://www.fogbowcloud.org/). SEBAL-scheduler abstracts away a complex distributed infra-structure and allows the user to focus on the application requirements.

The main features of the SEBAL-schedular are:
- feature 1
- feature 2
 
See the following topics to understand the **architecture** of the SEBAL-scheduler, how to **deploy and configure it**, and finally, how to use it to **execute** SEBAL tasks.

## SEBAL-scheduler architecture
SEBAL-scheduler is a distributed system to gather sattelite imagery, process the energy balance based on the images input, keep an inventory of the results and provide execution provance. This workflow is executed in a multi-cloud environment. The fogbow middleware aggregates and manages the computational resources dispersed among the cloud. In this section, we overview of the SEBAL-scheduler components used to execute its workflow and the interaction with the fogbow middleware.
